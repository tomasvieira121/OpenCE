# Notes for agents

This repository ports the Halo: Combat Evolved decompilation (Xbox build
01.01.14.2342, `cachebeta.exe`) to Linux, Windows and Android. The game's C
sources are the decompilation; the port adds a platform layer that
implements the Xbox APIs the game calls, and features the Xbox game did not
have (a new netcode, internet play, the PC version's menus, Custom Edition
maps, touch controls). The project is published as OpenCE.

Start with [README.md](README.md). The other documents are listed at the
end.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `source/` | The game: 466 C files of the decompilation, compiled as they are with few changes (each marked, below) |
| `port/linux/src/` | The platform layer the three ports share: Direct3D 8 on OpenGL (`d3d8_gl.c`), DirectSound and XInput on SDL3, files, threads, memory, sockets, settings (`port_config.c`), internet play (`p2p*.c`) |
| `port/linux/game/` | The port's game-side code, compiled as the game's sources are: the distributed netcode (`network_*.c`), co-op, the menus (`menu_tags.c`, `menu_functions.c`), Custom Edition maps (`custom_edition_*.c`, `cache_file_formats.c`), the tag validator (`tag_validate.c`, `tag_schema_*.c`), touch, FOV and more |
| `port/linux/include/` | The port's headers: the limits (`halo_port_limits.h`, with `HALO_PORT_NETWORK_VERSION`), capacities (`halo_port_capacity.h`), the prefix header, `halo_linux_source_fixups.h` (port functions the game's sources call) |
| `port/include/xdk/` | Stand-ins for the Xbox SDK's headers (declarations only) |
| `port/windows/` | The Windows build's own files (`win32_*.c`, headers) |
| `port/android/` | The Android app: the guest runtime, the host library (`host/`), the Java app (`app/`), host imports (`host_imports.list`) |
| `port/assets/` | What the builds embed or ship: high-res HUD (`hud/`), fonts, titles, menus (`menus/`), icons, network brokers |
| `port/third_party/` | Vendored libraries, each with a README naming its upstream, version and checksum |
| `port/tools/` | Stand-alone tools (`cache_file_report.c`) |
| `tools/` | Build scripts (`linux_build.py`, `windows_build.py`, `android_build.py`, `ci_build.py`), generators (`ce_menus.py`, `port_settings.py`, `hud_assets.py`, `title_assets.py`, `embed_assets.py`, `xdk_headers.py`) and tests |
| `docs/` | Longer design notes (`custom_edition_caches.md`) |
| `pgo/` | Profile-guided optimisation profiles |
| `assets/` | Game data for local runs (gitignored: `maps/`, `custom_maps/`) |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI: builds every platform on each push, publishes releases from `main` |

## Building

```sh
python configure.py            # debug build; add --release, --portable, --profile, --pgo=off, --lto=off
ninja linux                    # build/linux/halo
ninja android                  # the Android guest image and native libraries
ninja android_apk              # the APK (Gradle)
ninja windows                  # on Windows only
python tools/ci_build.py linux release   # what CI builds
```

- `configure.py` writes `build.ninja`; `configure_args` at its top records
  the options it was run with. Restore them after trying other options.
- The Linux and Windows builds are 32-bit x86 with clang, in MSVC's ABI
  (`-fms-extensions -fshort-wchar -malign-double -fcommon`), C89 (`gnu89`):
  declarations come before statements.
- Every native build compiles without fused multiply-add and with the
  vendored musl maths (`halo_math.h`), so that every machine of a network
  game computes the same results. Do not call the system's maths functions.
- Android: the game is an ILP32 AArch64 guest (`arm64_32`) in a 64-bit app.
  Guest code can call only the host imports declared in
  `port/android/host_imports.list` and `port/android/guest/runtime/guest_host.h`,
  and only the SDL functions `guest_sdl.c` bridges. Run `ninja android`
  after changing anything it compiles: `port/linux/src`, `port/linux/game`,
  `port/android`, `source/`, the build scripts.

### Defines

| Define | Set by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HALO_ANDROID` | Android | The app: its display, input, files and lifecycle |
| `HALO_GLES` | Android | The OpenGL ES renderer |
| `HALO_ARM64_GUEST` | Android | The guest's ABI (ILP32 AArch64) |
| `HALO_WINDOWS` | Windows (`halo_windows_prefix.h`) | The Windows build |
| `HALO_RELEASE` | `--release` | No assertions checked |
| `HALO_PROFILE` | `--profile` | The profiling build; a normal build must be unchanged by it |

`HALO_LINUX` and `HALO_CUSTOM_EDITION` are **not** defined by any build:
code guarded by them compiles to nothing. Custom Edition support is a
setting (`game.custom_edition`), checked at run time with
`custom_edition_cache_tags_loaded()`.

## Testing

```sh
python -m pytest -q tools/harness tools/test_touch_menu.py   # the engine's functions in a fake world
python -m pytest -q tools/test_linux_port.py                # the build, the maps' checks (needs assets/maps)
python -m pytest -q tools/test_cache_file_formats.py tools/test_bmp_files.py tools/test_profile.py
python tools/test_touch_layout.py                           # the Android touch layout (JDK 17+)
python tools/test_light_storage.py
python tools/test_death_timing.py
```

`tools/harness/README.md` explains how to add an asset-free test: the code
under test is taken from the sources, not copied.

Running the game without a person at it:

- `debug.network_test` (`HALO_NETWORK_TEST=host:<map>` or `join`) hosts or
  joins a game without the menus and logs each player's state every second;
  several copies play on one machine on different loopback addresses
  (`HALO_NET_ADDRESS`, `HALO_NET_BROADCAST`). `NETCODE.md` describes the
  test settings.
- `debug.exit_after`, `debug.hidden_window`, `debug.null_renderer`,
  `debug.menu_open` (start on one menu screen), `debug.telnet_console`.
- Use a virtual display (Xvfb, with `SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER=x11`) for windowed
  runs, never the desktop of the person you work for, and stop only the
  processes you started.

## Rules of the project

### The game's sources

- Change `source/` as little as possible, and mark each change from the
  original with a comment that starts `port:`. Write like the surrounding
  code: its naming, its comment density, and the project's plain,
  descriptive comment style.
- A port function the game's sources call is declared in
  `halo_linux_source_fixups.h` or included with a note naming its file
  (`#include "view_fov.h" /* port: port/linux/game/view_fov.c */`).
- Notes such as `BUG (original, preserved for exact matching)` mark the
  original's bugs. Fixing one is allowed; say so in a `port:` comment.

### The Xbox SDK

`port/include/xdk` was written without the SDK's headers, from the January
build's debug information and public documentation. Never read the SDK's
headers or anything derived from them, never copy from them, and do not
read `xbox/include`. To add a name, follow `port/include/xdk/README.md`.

### Networking

- Raise `HALO_PORT_NETWORK_VERSION` (`port/linux/include/halo_port_limits.h`)
  with any change to what the machines send each other, or to anything they
  must agree on, and say why in the commit. Machines of different versions
  do not play together.
- Only the host decides; clients predict their own players. Read
  `port/linux/NETCODE.md` before changing the netcode.
- Anything another machine sends is untrusted: check sizes, indices and
  rates, as the existing handlers do. `debug.network_corrupt` tests this.

### Menus

- The menus must match Halo Custom Edition's. Their XML (`port/assets/menus/ce/`)
  is generated by `tools/ce_menus.py` from the PC version's tags; the
  settings screens come from `tools/port_settings.py`. Do not edit the XML
  by hand: change the generator and run it (the command is in
  `port/assets/menus/README.md`, "Writing them again"), then check that
  `git status` shows only the screens meant to change.
- Functions the menus call but the port has not wired are listed in
  `port/assets/menus/UNWIRED.md`.

### Art and credit

- Replacement HUD, title and menu art is made of hand-drawn redraws.
- Prefer an existing redraw (the ui-svg-handmade set), then a new redraw. A
  Custom Edition picture that cannot reasonably be redrawn (a 3D render, a
  screenshot, a logo) may be used only if it is listed in
  `port/assets/menus/NON_HANDDRAWN.md`.
- `AUTHORS.md` credits art only.
- Fonts: Overpass and OpenCE (Newtown, respaced) only; see
  `port/assets/fonts/README.md`. Never ship the maps' commercial typefaces.

### Custom Edition maps

Custom Edition maps live in the data root's `custom_maps` folder with
`bitmaps.map`, `sounds.map` and `loc.map`; their level names are
`custom_maps\<name>`. OpenSauce features are not supported and must not be
added: a map that needs them is refused, and one that only carries
OpenSauce's header runs as stock Custom Edition runs it. Map files are
untrusted input: read them through bounds-checked readers. See
`docs/custom_edition_caches.md`.

### Settings

A setting is an entry in `port/linux/src/port_config.c`, with a default, an
environment variable and a comment that `config.toml` gets. Document it in
the settings table of `port/linux/README.md` (and the Android README for an
Android-only one). A departure from the stock game's look or behaviour
should be a setting, off or stock by default, unless the project decides
otherwise.

### Third-party code and licences

The repository is CC0. Vendored code goes in `port/third_party/<name>`,
copied unchanged, with a README naming the upstream, the version or commit,
the checksum and what uses it. GPL code (OpenSauce, Reclaimer) may be read
as documentation of file formats, never copied.

### Commits and pull requests

- Commit subjects are plain sentences saying what changed; the body says
  why and what was checked.
- A pull request is merged with a merge commit (`Merge pull request #N from
  <owner>/<branch>`), and follow-up changes go in separate commits whose
  subject ends with `(#N)`.
- A commit taken from a fork keeps its author and is made with
  `git cherry-pick -x`.
